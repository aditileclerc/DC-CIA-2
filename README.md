# Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Service in Go

This repository demonstrates a basic implementation of a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) system in Go. It includes both the server and client code to perform simple arithmetic operations (e.g., addition) over the network using Go's built-in net/rpc package.

This project implements an RPC-based service in Go, allowing clients to remotely call a method to add two integers. It demonstrates the fundamentals of creating a server, defining an RPC service interface, and interacting with the server through a client.

Features

  - A simple RPC service to add two integers.

  - Demonstrates server-client communication over TCP.

  - Clear separation of RPC service interface and implementation.
